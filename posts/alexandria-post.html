          Just got back from an amazing trip to <u>Alexandria</u>, and I’m still
          buzzing with excitement from everything I saw and experienced. This
          city has such a unique charm — where <em>ancient history</em> meets
          Mediterranean beauty, and it’s impossible not to fall in love with it.
          One of the first places I visited was the legendary
          <u>Bibliotheca Alexandrina</u>. It’s a modern tribute to the ancient
          <u>Library of Alexandria</u>, and it completely blew me away.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The architecture is stunning, with its sleek design and the way it
          faces the sea, almost as if it’s inviting the world’s knowledge to
          come ashore.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Inside, I spent hours wandering through its massive collection of
          books and exhibitions, learning about
          <em>Egypt’s contributions to art, science, and culture</em>. It’s such
          a serene, inspiring place that makes you feel like you’re part of
          something bigger.
        </p>

        <p>
          I couldn’t visit Alexandria without exploring its ancient side, so I
          headed over to the <u>Catacombs of Kom El Shoqafa</u>. Descending into
          this underground world was like stepping into a time capsule. The
          blend of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman influences in the carvings and
          tombs was fascinating.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s amazing to think about how these civilizations once converged in
          this very spot, leaving behind such a rich legacy. Of course, I had to
          visit the <u>Citadel of Qaitbay</u>, sitting proudly on the
          Mediterranean coast. This fortress has stood for centuries, guarding
          the city with its sturdy walls. Walking along its ramparts, I could
          see the beautiful blue sea stretching out endlessly — no wonder this
          spot was once home to the famous <u>Lighthouse of Alexandria</u>, one
          of the ancient wonders of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond the history, Alexandria’s modern side has a laid-back, coastal
          vibe that’s infectious. I spent afternoons strolling along the
          Corniche, with the cool sea breeze in my face and the sun glistening
          on the water. I stopped at some of the local cafes to enjoy fresh
          seafood — seriously, the fish here is out of this world! Grilled to
          perfection and bursting with flavor, it’s a must-try when in
          <u>Alexandria</u>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the highlights of my trip was a sunset boat ride on the
          Mediterranean. Watching the sky turn shades of pink and orange while
          sailing along the coast was pure magic. It felt like a perfect blend
          of relaxation and adventure, capturing the spirit of
          <u>Alexandria</u> itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Alexandria</u> has this incredible energy, a place where the old
          and new coexist effortlessly. Whether you’re walking through its
          historic streets or enjoying a seaside meal, there’s a sense of
          timelessness that makes you want to stay and explore more. I’m already
          planning my next visit!
