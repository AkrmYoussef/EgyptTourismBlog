      Just got back from an amazing trip to Alexandria, and I’m still buzzing
      with excitement from everything I saw and experienced. This city has such
      a unique charm — where ancient history meets Mediterranean beauty, and
      it’s impossible not to fall in love with it. One of the first places I
      visited was the legendary Bibliotheca Alexandrina. It’s a modern tribute
      to the ancient Library of Alexandria, and it completely blew me away. The
      architecture is stunning, with its sleek design and the way it faces the
      sea, almost as if it’s inviting the world’s knowledge to come ashore.
      Inside, I spent hours wandering through its massive collection of books
      and exhibitions, learning about Egypt’s contributions to art, science, and
      culture. It’s such a serene, inspiring place that makes you feel like
      you’re part of something bigger. I couldn’t visit Alexandria without
      exploring its ancient side, so I headed over to the Catacombs of Kom El
      Shoqafa. Descending into this underground world was like stepping into a
      time capsule. The blend of Egyptian, Greek, and Roman influences in the
      carvings and tombs was fascinating. It’s amazing to think about how these
      civilizations once converged in this very spot, leaving behind such a rich
      legacy. Of course, I had to visit the Citadel of Qaitbay, sitting proudly
      on the Mediterranean coast. This fortress has stood for centuries,
      guarding the city with its sturdy walls. Walking along its ramparts, I
      could see the beautiful blue sea stretching out endlessly — no wonder this
      spot was once home to the famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the
      ancient wonders of the world. The views from here are breathtaking, and
      it’s the perfect place to reflect on the city’s vibrant maritime history.
      Beyond the history, Alexandria’s modern side has a laid-back, coastal vibe
      that’s infectious. I spent afternoons strolling along the Corniche, with
      the cool sea breeze in my face and the sun glistening on the water. I
      stopped at some of the local cafes to enjoy fresh seafood — seriously, the
      fish here is out of this world! Grilled to perfection and bursting with
      flavor, it’s a must-try when in Alexandria. One of the highlights of my
      trip was a sunset boat ride on the Mediterranean. Watching the sky turn
      shades of pink and orange while sailing along the coast was pure magic. It
      felt like a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure, capturing the
      spirit of Alexandria itself. Alexandria has this incredible energy, a
      place where the old and new coexist effortlessly. Whether you’re walking
      through its historic streets or enjoying a seaside meal, there’s a sense
      of timelessness that makes you want to stay and explore more. I’m already
      planning my next visit!
